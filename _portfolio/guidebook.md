Scenario-based Sociotechnical Envisioning is a flexible method that imagines various outcomes from diverse perspectives. It allows for the concretisation of complex issues by highlighting the human interplay with technology. Scenario-based sociotechnical envisioning calls attention to the necessity of illuminating future pathways of technological interplay with individuals and society to inform decision-makers – whether regulatory or developer drivers – early on in technology development.

Rather than accurately predicting the future, scenario writing aims to imagine possible outcomes that can guide current actions toward better results. Scenario writing works best when it considers diverse perspectives, expertise, and experiences.

This method aims to contextualise use-scenarios for researchers and policy makers to better understand and reduce the potential risk of new technologies in society.
