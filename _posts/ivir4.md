I am delighted to serve (again) as a jury member for the 4th IViR IViR “Science Fiction & Information Law” writing competition. 

We are delighted to once again organise the competition in cooperation with the Digital Constitutionalist (DigiCon) and CPDP. Please check out the open (call)[https://www.ivir.nl/ivir-science-fiction-information-law-writing-competition-the-technologised-future-of-truth/] and consider submitting to our comepetition. 

We welcome short stories that do not exceed 6.000 words. Contributions by non-legal people are just as welcome as those from the legally trained, as long as they reflect on information(,) law and the future of truth, though the future could just already be now. Short stories are not: legal essays, case notes and texts with footnotes and bibliographies. It’s your ideas about the future of information (law) we are interested in, not your knowledge of the law. 

The submission deadline is January 31, 2026.
