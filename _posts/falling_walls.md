I had the great pleasure serving as a jury member at the Falling Walls Science Slam at Johannesburg, 2025. 

16 researchers and innovators presented their research in 3 minute presentations. You can read the summary of the event [here](https://www.daad.org.za/en/2025/07/31/falling-walls-lab-johannesburg-2025-breaking-barriers-building-futures/).
