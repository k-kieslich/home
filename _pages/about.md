Hi, my name is Kimon and I am a social scientist working on socio-technial impacts of data-driven technologies. My academic focus lies on risk assessment and management of data-driven technologies, governance of AI, human-machine interaction, and the impacts on AI on individuals and society.

I am currently working as a postdoctoral fellow at the African German Centre for Sustainable and Resilient Food Systems and Applied Agricultural and Food Data Science [(UKDULA)](https://ukudla.uni-hohenheim.de/en) at the University of Hohenheim situated at the University of Pretoria. I am also affiliated with the [AI, Media & Democracy Lab](https://www.aim4dem.nl/) at the University of Amsterdam.

I am also co-developer of the method of [Scenario-Based Sociotechnical Envisioning](https://www.aim4dem.nl/guidebook-on-scenario-based-sociotechnical-envisioning/).
