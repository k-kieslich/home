Hello, 

my name is Kimon and I am a social scientist working on socio-technial impacts of data-driven technologies. My academic focus lies on risk assessment and management of data-driven technologies, governance of AI, human-machine interaction, and the impacts on AI on individuals and society.

I am currently working as a postdoctoral fellow at the African German Centre for Sustainable and Resilient Food Systems and Applied Agricultural and Food Data Science [(UKDULA)](https://ukudla.uni-hohenheim.de/en) at the University of Hohenheim situated at the University of Pretoria. I am also affiliated with the [AI, Media & Democracy Lab](https://www.aim4dem.nl/) at the University of Amsterdam. 

I received my PhD in communication science from the University of Hohenheim in 2024, and worked as a postdoctoral research at the University of Amsterdam from 2023-2025. 

I have a wide portfolio in methodological skills reaching from quantitative (surveys, content analysis) to qualtitative (scenario-writing, thematic analysis) skills. I am also co-developer of the method of [Scenario-Based Sociotechnical Envisioning](https://www.aim4dem.nl/guidebook-on-scenario-based-sociotechnical-envisioning/).
