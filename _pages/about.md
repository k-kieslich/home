Hi, my name is Kimon and I am a social scientist studying the social and political implications of data-driven technologies, with a particular focus on AI ethics, public perceptions of algorithms, and the societal impacts of automated decision-making. My work examines how these technologies are designed, governed, and experienced in practice, especially in contexts shaped by inequality and global power relations.

I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the African-German Centre for Sustainable and Resilient Food Systems and Applied Agricultural and Food Data Science [(UKDULA)](https://ukudla.uni-hohenheim.de/en) at the University of Hohenheim, based at the University of Pretoria in South Africa. I am also affiliated with the [AI, Media & Democracy Lab](https://www.aim4dem.nl/) at the University of Amsterdam, where I contribute to interdisciplinary research on AI, media systems, and democratic governance.

My research sits at the intersection of social sciences, computer science, law, and psychology, and I actively collaborate across these fields. My methodological expertise spans quantitative approaches such as surveys and content analysis, as well as qualitative approaches including scenario-writing and thematic analysis. I am co-developer of [Scenario-Based Sociotechnical Envisioning](https://www.aim4dem.nl/guidebook-on-scenario-based-sociotechnical-envisioning/), a method for exploring and evaluating possible futures of AI and other data-driven technologies.
