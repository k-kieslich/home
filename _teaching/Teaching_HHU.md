Methods Training, Theory Seminars, Empirical Research Seminars & Thesis Supervision

Methods training:

From the summer term 2018 to the winter term 2020 I tought methods courses for empirical data analysis. The topics included in this courses were: data collection, statistical reasoning, descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, mean comparisons (t-test, ANOVA), and linear regression. The statistical software used was SPSS and R. For the courses R, I co-edited a tutorial publication published on the library server of the Heinrich Heine University (see Tools).

Theory seminars:

In the winter term 2018 and summer term 2019 I tought two theory seminars - one on fear communication and one on populism research. In both courses students had to engage with relevant literature and hold presentations on course topics. Further, students had to develop a theory-driven empirical research design for a hypothethical study on the course topic. Examination modes in these courses were written essays or oral presentations.

Empirical research seminar:

Together with a colleague I conduceted a research seminar on fairness in ADM systems in the winter term 2020. I gave input presentations and provided literature. Under my supervisions, the students developed an empirical research design, collected corresponding data, and analyzed and presented the findings. Examination mode of this course was a written research report.

Theses:

Between the winter term 2018 and the summer term 2022 I (co-)supervised five Bachelor and three Master theses. Topic included populism research, fear communication, and public opinion on AI. All students successfully graduated.
