Journalistic work is undergoing a process of change as a result of digitalization. Within thisprocess, artificial intelligence (AI) plays an important role. AI systems can not only assist jour-nalists in the distribution of news, but also support research and even write articles autono-mously. But what does the German population think about these developments? We investi-gated precisely this as part of our Opinion Monitor Artificial Intelligence (Meinungmonitor KI[Me:Mo KI]). Our results show that the use of AI in journalistic newsrooms is viewed very criti-cally by the German population. Not only is there little to no presumed improvement with re-gards to overall journalistic quality, many citizens are also in favor of strong regulations for AIsystems in media and journalism. Despite the overall critical assessment of its use, the surveyedcitizens expect AI to be able to perform some journalistic tasks better than human journalists.Journalistic editorial offices should therefore only use AI technologies in a well-justified andtransparent manner.
