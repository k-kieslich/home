In a special survey, the opinion monitor artificial intelligence (Meinungsmonitor Künstliche Intelligenz [MeMo:KI]) investigated how the German population perceives the relation between artificial intelligence (AI) and environmental sustainability. By and large, a view of AI that sees it as part of the solution rather than part of the problem predominates: Accordingly, AI is seen more as an opportunity to achieve environmental sustainability goals; the ecological costs caused (e.g., through energy and water consumption) are perceived as less serious. Overall, the results suggest widespread ignorance about the relationship between AI and environmental sustainability. This also results in an undifferentiated perception when attributing responsibility. Nevertheless, compliance with environmental sustainability goals is understood as a task for society as a whole. As possible measures for an informed and democratic discourse on the ecological opportunities and risks of AI, we suggest broader media attention and educational offerings that specifically convey competence in the subject matter.
