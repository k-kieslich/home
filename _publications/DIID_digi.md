The digitalization of work may lead to massive job losses in near future. However, public opinion polls show, that concerns regarding losing one’s job are currently quite low. I argue that this gap is explainable through simply framing this development as “digitalization”, which is a highly positive connoted term in German media landscape. In contrast, referring to the same process in a more technical way as “robotization”, will lead to a higher amount of fear for losing one’s job. I tested this assumption in a quantitative online experiment (N=214) and found partial support for my hypothesis.
